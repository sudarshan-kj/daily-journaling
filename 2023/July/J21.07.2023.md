### Realisations

In the morning after Yogasanas, brain was very sharp and kept on seeing what we are doing. How we are grouping and labeling things all the time, and mostly when we do that, that's when we feel we understand something. 
Also, on how sublte boundaries are in computers which is very abstract. Everything in a computer is just a program. We are calling kernel, files, directories, etc. End of the day, we are seeing images, text, but they are all in real just bits. Also got this feeling that we are just connecting sounds with a meaning that's only in our heads. What we make up is entirely our thing. Could have dug deeper, then went to wash rug.
