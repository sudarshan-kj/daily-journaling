## Journaling D7

09.08.2023

Yesterday was one of the best days I have ever had. Did Surya Kriya after reading an article Amulya had sent where SG had talked about the effects of inhaling deeply and doing the Kriya. Tried it and it turned out great. After that, went to Naadaradhana at 5.50PM and it was one hell of an experience there. 1 hour just flew by and I could have sat for longer. Clearly there was some distance between me and my mind. I could see it.
Then Ashmitha had called, so called her back while walking back and told her about this. Felt really really good TBH. It is one such experience that could make fundamental changes in your thinking and life since you have had a peek of what this entire path can offer through a small window.

Today has been good. Ofcourse, I compared it with yesterday and felt okayish because of that. Work wise also things are fine. A bit not okay that I was not included in the ILA group which Rashmi Akka had created. After dinner, feeling a bit too tired. Went near Moondram and had 2 sweets. They were good. Also had Pineapple Lime Juice. Lot of tiredness even while writing this. Itchy throat and cough. Somehow I am not fully physically fit from a long time now, and it makes me wonder why.
